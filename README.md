# Disease Outcome Predictor

A Streamlit web application that predicts the health outcome of patients based on disease type, symptoms, demographic, and health indicators using a Random Forest classifier.

## Overview

This web application allows users to input patient-specific information, including disease, symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing), age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. It processes these inputs, applies necessary preprocessing and encoding, and predicts the patientâ€™s outcome using a trained Random Forest model on a disease symptom and patient profile dataset.

## Features

- Select from a comprehensive list of diseases.
- Input symptoms and demographic data via an interactive UI.
- Automatic encoding of categorical variables.
- Real-time prediction of patient outcome using a machine learning model.
- Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The model uses a CSV dataset named `disease_dataset.csv` containing patient profiles, symptoms, diseases, and outcome variables.

## Working

- The model is trained each time a prediction is made, which might affect performance.
- Categorical variables like gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are manually encoded.
- Ensure input values match expected formats to avoid runtime errors.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
